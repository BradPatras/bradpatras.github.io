                    After seeing the <a href="https://github.com/cassidoo/todometer">todometer desktop app</a>, a project by a fellow ISU alum <a href="https://cassidoo.co/">Cassidy Williams</a>, I thought it would be a fun project to write a native Android version. I also used it as a platform for learning the Android Room persistence library. Overall it was a fun exercise to try to convert all the functionality of a web app onto a mobile platform, abiding by the expected user experience of Android, while also keeping a common design language with the original app.

                <p>
                    GPX Recorder came from the desire to have an app that I could use while on multi-day backpacking trips to record my route on my phone without worrying about the app draining my battery. The name comes from the other main function of the app: exporting the routes to the .gpx file format, which is one of the most popular gps data standards.

                    This app was started as my project for a 36 hour hackathon at Iowa State. The initial design was... rough and since it was one of my first exposures to Android app development (and software development in general) the code was equally rough. I released it onto the Google Play Store and have given it some redesigns and small code cleanups over the years but the code would require a lot more work to get it up to my current standards for app development. It's a good reminder for myself of how far I've come as an Android developer.
