# Road Bike Recommendations (April 2019)

__Groupset:__ The shifting system of the bike. All you need to know, Tiagra \> Sora

__Brakes:__ Disc vs Rim: Disc used to be a mountain bike thing but now road bikes are adopting them as well. Disc brakes have more positives than negatives compared to rim brakes. But honestly both are great and its not a big deal either way.
